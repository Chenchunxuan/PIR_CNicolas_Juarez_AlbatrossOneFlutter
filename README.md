Flutter sensibility to semi-aeroelastic hinged wing parameters


The benefits of high aspect ratio wings in liftinduced drag are well known. However, this solution has welldefined limits imposed by airport regulation and increasing loads. The introduction of a hinged wingtip is a possible solution for both problems. The aim of this research is to study the influence of hinge parameters on the flutter performance of the wing.
